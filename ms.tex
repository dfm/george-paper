\section{The Gaussian likelihood}

It is commonly assumed that a set of data points with error bars represent
independent measurements with Gaussian uncertainties of known variance.
Under this assumption, for a model $f(\bvec{x};\,\bvec{\theta})$, the
likelihood for a single data point $y_n$ measured at coordinates $\bvec{x}_n$
with error bar $\sigma_n$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
p(y_n\,|\,\bvec{x}_n,\,\sigma_n,\,\bvec{\theta}) &=&
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\,\pi\,{\sigma_n}^2}}\,\exp\left(
    -\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{{[y_n-f(\bvec{x};\,\bvec{\theta})]}^2}{{\sigma_n}^2}
    \right) \quad.
\end{eqnarray}
Therefore, the joint likelihood for a set of $N$ data points ${\{\bvec{x}_n,\,
y_n,\, \sigma_n\}}_{n=1}^N$ is
\begin{eqnarray}\eqlabel{ind-like}
p(\{y_n\}\,|\,\{\bvec{x}_n,\,\sigma_n\},\,\bvec{\theta}) &=&
    \prod_{n=1}^N\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\,\pi\,{\sigma_n}^2}}\,\exp\left(
    -\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{{[y_n-f(\bvec{x};\,\bvec{\theta})]}^2}{{\sigma_n}^2}
    \right) \quad.
\end{eqnarray}
It is common practice to work with the natural logarithm of this quantity
instead of the likelihood directly.
Taking the logarithm of \eq{ind-like}, we find
\begin{eqnarray}\eqlabel{ind-loglike}
\log p(\{y_n\}\,|\,\{\bvec{x}_n,\,\sigma_n\},\,\bvec{\theta}) &=&
    -\frac{1}{2}\,\sum_{n=1}^N\left[
    \frac{{[y_n-f(\bvec{x};\,\bvec{\theta})]}^2}{{\sigma_n}^2}
    +\log {(2\,\pi\,{\sigma_n}^2)}
    \right]\quad.
\end{eqnarray}
It is worth qualitatively considering the roles of the two terms in
\eq{ind-loglike} because this discussion will come up repeatedly throughout
this paper.
The first term within the square brackets is what is commonly referred to as
``$\chi^2$'' in the astronomy literature and it quantifies the
``goodness-of-fit'' of the model.
The second term quantifies the specificity of the model and penalizes overly
general models.
For fixed uncertainties $\{\sigma_n\}$, this second term is a constant with
respect to the parameters $\bvec{\theta}$ and maximizing the log-likelihood in
\eq{ind-loglike} is equivalent to minimizing $\chi^2$.
In other words, calculating $\chi^2$ requires assuming that the uncertainties
are independent Gaussians with known variance.

This more general formulation of the Gaussian likelihood function will come in
handy for our derivation of GP modeling shortly, but let's start with a
concrete example where minimizing $\chi^2$ is not sufficient.
It is not uncommon for uncertainties on astronomical quantities to be
underestimated or unknown.
In this case, we must fit for a parametric representation of the uncertainties
simultaneously with the model $f(\bvec{x};\,\bvec{\theta})$.
To do this, we might include another parameter, we'll call it $s$, to quantify
the amount by which the uncertainties are underestimated.
In this case, the likelihood becomes
\begin{eqnarray}\eqlabel{jitter-loglike}
\log p(\{y_n\}\,|\,\{\bvec{x}_n,\,\sigma_n\},\,\bvec{\theta},\,s) &=&
    -\frac{1}{2}\,\sum_{n=1}^N\left[
    \frac{{[y_n-f(\bvec{x};\,\bvec{\theta})]}^2}{{\sigma_n}^2 + s^2}
    +\log {(2\,\pi\,[{\sigma_n}^2+s^2])}
    \right]
\end{eqnarray}
and we can now maximize this with respect to both $\bvec{\theta}$ and $s$.
